# Challenges & Solutions

During the development of the Crypto Price Tracker, we encountered several challenges and implemented solutions to address them. This document outlines these challenges and how we overcame them.

## API Rate Limiting

### Challenge

The CoinGecko API has rate limits on its free tier (approximately 10-50 calls per minute). Exceeding these limits results in API errors and a poor user experience.

### Solution

We implemented a multi-layered caching strategy:

1. **Client-Side Caching**: Used React Query's `staleTime` option to prevent unnecessary refetches
2. **Manual Refresh**: Added a manual refresh button so users can control when to fetch fresh data
3. **Error Handling**: Implemented robust error handling to gracefully handle rate limit errors

## Search Performance

### Challenge

Implementing a search feature that filters cryptocurrencies efficiently without causing performance issues.

### Solution

1. **Client-Side Filtering**: Performed filtering on the client side to avoid unnecessary API calls
2. **Optimized Filtering Logic**: Used simple, efficient filtering logic

```tsx
const filteredCoins =
  data?.filter(
    (coin) =>
      coin.name.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase()) ||
      coin.symbol.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase())
  ) || [];
```

## Loading States

### Challenge

Providing a good user experience during loading states, especially for the initial data fetch.

### Solution

1. **Skeleton UI**: Implemented skeleton loading states that match the layout of the actual content
2. **React Query**: Leveraged React Query's `isLoading` state to conditionally render loading UI

## Error Handling

### Challenge

Handling various error scenarios (API errors, network issues, rate limiting) in a user-friendly way.

### Solution

1. **Centralized Error Handling**: Implemented error handling in the API client
2. **User-Friendly Error Messages**: Displayed clear error messages to users
3. **Retry Mechanism**: Used React Query's built-in retry functionality
4. **Fallback UI**: Designed a fallback UI for when data cannot be fetched

## Documentation

### Challenge

Creating comprehensive documentation that is both technical and accessible.

### Solution

1. **Docusaurus**: Used Docusaurus to create a dedicated documentation site
2. **Structured Content**: Organized documentation into logical sections
3. **Code Examples**: Included relevant code examples
4. **Setup Instructions**: Provided clear setup and installation instructions

## Conclusion

By addressing these challenges with thoughtful solutions, we were able to create a robust, user-friendly Crypto Price Tracker application. The solutions we implemented not only resolved the immediate challenges but also laid the groundwork for future enhancements and features.
